# Terminology

**Executable Scenario Concept**

: Executable Scenarios (ExSce) are model-based narrative descriptions of robotic missions guiding
  the engineering of MRS applications. An ExSce supports the definition of scenarios, composed of
  mission-relevant and mission-plausible information. On the one hand, by mission-relevant information
  we refer to, among others, the environment and its dynamics, time and events, objects
  (e.g., inspected building) and subjects (e.g., human operators) and their potential behaviour.
  On the other hand, the mission-plausible information describes acceptance criteria that enable
  the verification and validation of MRS requirements. Both, mission-plausible and mission-relevant
  information are computer-interpretable models and hence enable the transformation into artefacts
  which can be executed in different contexts such as in simulators or on real robots.

**Executable Scenario Methodology**

: To put the ExSce concept into action, the ExSce methodology enables the structured development of
  MRS from stakeholdersâ€™ scenarios. Hence, it comprises both a tailorable process model and
  associated tools that guide and support the stakeholders in
  (i) specifying scenarios;
  (ii) transforming them to executable artefacts;
  (iii) executing those artefacts;
  (iv) assuring the quality of the MRS in those scenarios; and
  (v) generalizing those scenarios.

**Executable Scenario Workbench**

: The ExSce Workbench is a collection of tools that supports stakeholders in carrying out one or more
  activities of the ExSce Methodology.
