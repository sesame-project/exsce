# Executable Scenario Workbench

The ExSce Workbench is a collection of tools that supports stakeholders in carrying out one or more
activities of the [ExSce Methodology](terminology.md). This includes:

- [Floor Plan DSL](https://github.com/sesame-project/FloorPlan-DSL):
  A DSL for modeling the indoor floor plans of buildings.
- [kindyngen](https://github.com/hbrs-sesame/kindyngen) is a toolchain to transform
  composable models of kinematic chains and queries thereupon into correct-by-construction
  solver code.
- [bdd-dsl](https://hbrs-sesame.github.io/bdd-dsl/): metamodels and associated tooling for
  applying the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) process to test robotic scenarios.
