# Executable Scenario Workbench

The ExSce Workbench is a collection of tools that supports stakeholders in carrying out one or more
activities of the [ExSce Methodology](terminology.md). This includes:

- [Floor Plan DSL](https://github.com/sesame-project/FloorPlan-DSL):
  A DSL for modeling the indoor floor plans of buildings
- Metamodels to specify robots' kinematic chains, whose descriptions can be found on our
  [models' landing page](https://sesame-project.github.io/exsce/exsce-repo.html).
  A [tutorial](https://github.com/comp-rob2b/modelling-tutorial/) is also available
  showing how to compose these metamodels into kinematic chain models.
- [bdd-dsl](https://hbrs-sesame.github.io/bdd-dsl/): metamodels and associated tooling for
  applying Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to test robotic scenarios.
