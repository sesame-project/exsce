# Executable Scenario

This is the landing page for the work done in the context of the Executable Scenario (ExSce)
work package of the [SESAME project](https://www.sesame-project.org/). This includes:

1. **[Executable Scenario Management](https://github.com/hbrs-sesame/exsce_management)**:
   graph-based scenario-management approach.
2. **[An open repository of executable scenarios](exsce-repo.md)**:
   A repository of models and metamodels developed to support scenario specification for
   Multi-Robot Systems (MRS).
3. **[Executable Workbench](exsce-workbench.md)**: collection of tools that supports stakeholders
   in carrying out one or more activities of the ExSce Methodology.

The models and tools developed so far for ExSce target specific use cases and as such support only
relevant subsets of the activities listed in the ExSce Methodology (see
[terminology page](terminology.md) for definition). For other use cases and activities,
users should enrich and extend ExSce with suitable models and tools accordingly,
the process of which is enabled by our methodology.

The ExSce workbench has been used to support the following scientific articles
(chronologically ordered):

   Specification and Generation for Simulation-Based Testing of Mobile Robot Navigation Stacks",
