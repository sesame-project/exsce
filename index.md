    graph-based scenario-management approach
2. **[An open repository of executable scenarios](exsce-repo.md)**:
    A repository of models and metamodels developed to support scenario specification for
    Multi-Robot Systems (MRS).
3. **[Executable Workbench](exsce-workbench.md)**: collection of tools that supports stakeholders
    in carrying out one or more activities of the ExSce Methodology.

The ExSce workbench has been used to support the following scientific articles:

1. ICRA paper (Sven and Desiana)
2. IROS paper (Samuel and Argen)
3. CASE paper (Salman)
4. M. Nguyen, N. Hochgeschwender, S. Wrede, "An analysis of behaviour-driven requirement specification for robotic competitions", [_5th International Workshop on Robotics Software Engineering (RoSEâ€™23)_](https://rose-workshops.github.io/rose2023/), May 2023.
